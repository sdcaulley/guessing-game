      <h3 id="early">The Early Years</h3>
      <p>I was born in Tenessee and lived there until I was 4 years old.  During that time my parents adopted my younger brother, James.  We then moved to Myrtle Point, Oregon.  It is a little logging community between Roseburg and Coos Bay.  We lived there until my 10th birthday.  I attended kindergarten, first and second grades at the local schools.  Third grade I was homeschooled as we prepared to move to Africa.</p>
      <p>My younger brother Brent was born while we were there.</p>
      <h3 id="africa">Africa</h3>
      <p>The summer I turned 10, my family moved to Ndola, Zambia, in southern Africa.  We spent 5 years there with a year and a half back in Oregon between years 3 and 4.  I graduated high school from a boarding school in Kenya.</p>

      <h3 id="army">Army Years</h3>
      <p>After high school I returned to the United States.  I did a year of college and then joined the Army.

I was with the Guard for 3 year, and deployed to Iraq during that time.</p>
      <h3 id="portland">Portland Til Now</h3>
      <p>After Iraq I moved back to Portland.  I met the man who is now my husband a few months after arriving.  We have a house on the east side which we share with two small dogs - Tux and Gumdrop.</p>
