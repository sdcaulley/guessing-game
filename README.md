# guessing-game

This is a basic html web page with biographical data.  At the end of the page are two guessing games. Questions for the games are asked in prompt boxes.  The user's answers and whether they are correct or not is printed to the screen below the button.

The css for the nav box and wrapping the main text around it came from the demo css at CSS Zen Garden (www.csszengarden.com).
